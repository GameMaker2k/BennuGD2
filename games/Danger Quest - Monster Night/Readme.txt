Goal
------------
The goal of this game is locate the 10 treasure chests.  There is 1 treasure chest hidden on each level.  But beware!  As you hunt for treasure, a monster hunts you!






Gameplay
------------
Once you have started a game, press "A" or click the "Roll" button to roll the dice.

Based on the way the dice land, you can move your characters that many positions through the level.  You must divide your turn amongst your characters.  You can choose to use all of your moves on one character, or divide your moves as you see fit.

To change the character you are controlling, either press "Y" or "X" to scroll through them, or you can click on a characters icon on the right side of the screen.  If the character is on screen, you can also simply click on that character.


Once you've rolled the dice, arrows will appear around the currently selected player.  You can move your character 2 ways:

1-Click on the arrow of the direction you would like to move. That tile will light up red.  You can drag the stylus as many spaces up until the edge of the screen, or until you are out of moves, or anywhere in-between.  When you release, the character will walk to the space you've indicated. If there is an obsitcal in his way, he will stop, however.

2-Use the directional pad to select the direction you would like to move.  A red highlighter will appear.  Move the highlighter to the spot you would like, using the directional pad, and then press "A" button on controller.


After your moves are used up, the monster will roll the dice and take his turn hunting down your characters.  After he rolls the dice, an icon will appear on the screen to indicate the monster is selecting his path.  You will not be able to do anything while the icon is up.
