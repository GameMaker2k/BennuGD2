rhighscore.file --> Rush Mode Records
qhighscore.file --> Quota Mode Records
ghighscore.file --> Glass Mode Records

and rename it like:

newrhighscore.file 
newqhighscore.file
newghighscore.file

Paste it in your files directory and run the game... Puzsion will merge the two Higscores tables with only the best records.
BEWARE: PUT THE NAME OF THE FILES WITH LOWCAPS!!!
