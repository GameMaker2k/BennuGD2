2019-06-10:

- Add MAP_SET_PALETTE(fileid, graphid, first_color, ncolors, byte * RGBA_data )
      MAP_GET_PALETTE(fileid, graphid, first_color, ncolors, byte * RGBA_data )

    NOTE: Only works with 8 bits surfaces, when the texture is updated the changes made in texture are lost.
          The texture is updated with original surface, changes made with map_clear* or map_put_pixel are considered as original surface.
          Original palette is replaced.
          Support alpha by color index.

- Rework aspect ratio, remove old defines, new modes are:
    SRA_PRESERVE
    SRA_OVERSCAN
    SRA_FIT

    NOTE: SRA_FIT have issues, don't adjust aspect ratio when texture rotate, use only if use non-rotate textures


- Add CLAMP(value, min, max), CLAMPF(double value, double min, double max)

- Add TEXTURE_SET_QUALITY(quality)
    quality can be:
        Q_NEAREST   (default)
        Q_LINEAR
        Q_BEST

    NOTE: Only works with new or non drawed textures. If you want to apply on exist maps, you must unload them and load them again.

- Fixed timer

- Fix fullscreen/window mode, grab and borderless.

- Fix WRITE_VALUE

- Rework FADE

    FADE( to_R, to_G, to_B, to_A, time_in_miliseconds )
    FADE_ON( time_in_miliseconds )          - Fade to normal
    FADE_OFF( time_in_miliseconds )         - Fade to black

- BugFix with FLOAT convertions from/to INTs types

- Remove some variables

- Group global variables

- Update texture if surface changed

- Fix SQRT name, error was named as SIRT
